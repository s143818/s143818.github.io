          <h3>Motivation and goal</h3>
          <p>Music is an important part of the everyday life for most people. Whether it be music for a party, for the bus or the inescapable noice you hear in a telephone queue, it affects us in some way or another. But which words are we actually hearing when we put on our headphones? Are we exposing ourselves to positive or negative messages? Are we subconsciously choosing to listen to negative songs or postitive? And lastly how does the artists connect to one another, and what information can we derive from the different groupings? <br><br>

These are the questions we seek to answer in this study and to do just that we need some data. But to get these data, we first need to limit our search. There are quite frankly too many artists across the world for us to take them all into account with the limited computer power that we possess, so in order to make it manageble we chose to focus on only one particular genre of music.

With it's rich history, interesting vocabulary and amazing artists we believe that we can uncover quite a lot of hidden secrets within this branch of music, as well as proving/disproving wether hip hop music is as violent/negative as people believe it to be.

          <h3>Dataset</h3>
          <p>As mentioned, we are using the wikipedia list of important hip hop artists to limit the scope of artists in the hip hop genre. After that we are using the genius API to extract the necesary data and link the artists based on the collaborations they've had on songs. We're using the amount of collaboration between two artists as the weight of the link, and we are adding five attributes to each node: Popularity, followers, twitter-handle, facebook name and instagram-name. Each artist also have as attributes the songs they've made or collaborated on, and these songs have the attributes: hotness, pyongs, release date, page views, media platforms and title.</p>

                Here we see the network of artists and the songs that they have collaborated on and that therefore connect them. At the edges of the graph, small nodes can be seen without any connections, this can occur if an artist hasn't collaborated with anyone, perhaps because they are unpopular, do not use the Genius platform or simply likes doing things alone.<br><br></p></div>

                Communities in dense networks can often be hard to see with the naked eye. The concept is based on the fact that within any network there will be some groups of nodes that are more densely connected than others, this can in this case be caused by the fact that some artists are better friends with one another than others, or maybe because some artists are connected through their chosen genre. <br>
                In the graph above 110 different communities were found, this number is of course also influenced by the amount of people who has no actual connection to the graph.<br>
                We have decided to check if the artists are in fact connected through their genres. Below is twelwe pie charts that show the overall distribution of genres over the members of the six biggest communities. The first piechart includes the rap category, but since it takes up the majority of the chart we decided to omit it in the second version.<br><br>This means that for each community there are two pie charts, and the further down you look the smaller the communities.</p></div>

              As it can be seen on the pie charts a lot of the artists have a majority of songs in the rap genre, This means that there is very little seperating the different communities in terms of the genres when rap is a part of it. You may be able to argue that the fourth biggest community is rather based on pop. <br>
              You may also be able to argue that the second largest community is quite based on rap, but you would need to apply statistic methods to see if it a statistically significant change based on the other pie charts.<br>
              The other set of pie charts, where rap is omitted only seem to strengthen the assumption that the artists don't collaborate with one another based on genre.<br>
              A funny thing to consider is that it is a very low percentage of artists whose song has the hip hop genre.<br><br></p>

                 On genius there is an attribute for each song that denotes the song hot or not. In this graph we see <orange>all the artists who does <b>NOT</b> have any hot songs colored orange</orange>, and <red>the <b>HOT</b> artists are colored in red.</red><br>
                  As seen on the graph genius only thinks that four artists got what it takes namely: Eminem, Travis Scott, XXXTENTACION and Mariah Carey (which could have something to do with the fact that we pulled this information close to christmas).<br>
              This however only seem to prove that maybe the genius attribute isn't that much to go on, when only 4 out of 110632 songs were shown as being hot.<br><br></p></div>

                Since the hotness attribute did not appear to be particularly usefull as a measure for popularity we decided to look at how many followers each artist had. On the graph above it is possible to see the same communities as in the communities tab, but in this graph the nodes are scaled by how many followers each artist has.<br>
                  In this plot we can see that we have a pink group that all have a lot of followers, considering their large node size. It is also possible to see that the rest of the communities doesn't share any common traits based on the followers count.<br>
                  The two people with the largest follower count is Kendrick Lamar with 22676 followers and Eminem with 19572 followers.<br><br></p></div>

                The genius api offers a way to see which sub genres a song belongs to. For all the songs of each artist we took this information and for each node we saw which genre the artist had the most of and colored them acordingly. It is obvious that one color holds the majority, mainly rap, the dark green dots and pop, which is shown as pink.<br><br></p></div>

      <p>Above is two plots of the degree distribution. The degree distribution in this case describes the amount of unique people an artist have collaborated with. As it can be seen on the graph the degree distribution follows a power law distribution. This means that if an artist in the network is popular, then he or she is more likely to make new collaborations that others. This can be easily translated to the graph as more artist would have a desire to collaborate with more well known artists either to boost their own success through their followers, or simply because they would be more likely to have heard of a popular artist that matched a certain music style. This results in a distribution where a lot of the artist only have one or two connections, whilst popular artists can have up to 250 collaborations with.</p>

		<p>Even if the degree distribution follows a power law distribution, meaning that a lot of nodes only have very few links, the graph is still full of connections. There are a lot of ways to group artists together such as the community method as seen above. Another way includes a specific centrality measure, mainly cliques. A clique is a group of artists where all the artists have connections to all other artists in the clique. If you were to move the slider beneath you would notice that both the value and the graph is changing. The value shows how big cliques we are looking for, if we have a value of three, and an artist is visible, then it means that the artist is a part of one or multiple three-artist-cliques where everyone is connected to oneanother. As the value reach fourteen you will see the names of the people in the largest clique.<br><br></p>

      </div>
      <p>Based on these graphs we can conclude that even though a lot of nodes do not have a high degree, then they are still quite connected to the rest of the graph considering that GET A PERCENTAGE of the nodes is in a 3-clique, and GET ANOTHER NUMBER is in a 4-clique. We can also conclude that the most interconnected artist, aka the ones in the 14-clique are quite famous artists.</p>

          <h3>A closer look at Snoop Dogg</h3>
		<p>Snoop Dogg is by far one of the most developing artists we have today. A simple look at how his name has changed during his career is enough to confirm this. We wanted to investigate if his language showed any sign of these transformations.<br>
            On the figure below we see a colomn of words and a list of years. The orange dots indicate wether or not Snoop Dogg has said any of these things in his lyrics during those years.<br><br></p>
		<img src="img/snoopy.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Degree distribution shown with linear scale" style="width: 100%;
	border-radius: 0px 0 0px 0;
	box-shadow: 0px 0 #ff9900;">
          <p><br>
              As it can be seen on the figure above, the word "snoop" is said in almost every single year except for 2005, which is weird since he didn't go under an alterego at the time. However the word lion almost also appear each year, showing that he might have considered the idea of changing his name to Snoop Lion before he actually did it in 2012. <br>
          The words "gangsta" and "bitch" is also mentioned quite a lot, bitch is said more than his own name. This supports the stereotype that hip hop artists doesn't use the nicest words. Even during 2012 when he declared that he was Bob Marley reincarnate and wanted to turn his back on guns and violence did he use these words in his lyricks. <br>
          Other words are not exactly linked to Snoop Dogg as a person, except maybe the word "international" that loosely follows when he became an international star, but they follow other events. As an example is Donald Trump, in 2004 he started his career as the host of an NBC show, but he was always somewhat of a local celebrity. Of course he is mentioned much more often after his electorial campaign as the consistent front-runner for the republican nomination in 2015, here he used the slogan: "Deal with it".<br>
              His relation to Pharrell and Wiz Khalifa is also clear. Pharrell as an older relation, as they released an album in 2002, and Khalifa, who is newer on the stage than Snoop Dogg meaning that he would not have known him before later in his career.
              <br><br> 
              The conclusion here is that the changes in his own deameanor and personality cannot be linked to these words at least.

      <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>A sentiment analysis is an analysis of wether a text is positive or negative. We use a sentiment dictionary, which is a list of words that have been rated by unpaid first year psykology students on a scale from 1 to 9 in how they were affected by the word. This list is the basis for the analysis and </p>

        <h3>Overall sentiment</h3>
        <p>The overall sentiment of the hip hop artist is actually slightly above average. With a mean value of 5.38 on a scale that goes from 1 to 9, this seems like a good indication that the bad reputation hip hop artists have when it comes to a negative influence is highly overrated. </p>

        <h3>Negative wordcloud</h3>
        <p>To investigate this further we decided to look at some of the distinctive words for artists with both the most negative and the most positive sentiment values. <br>This wordcloud contains the top tf-idf words for the artists with the lowest sentiment values. This means that we here have the most distincitive words for the negative artists in our graph.<br>
          This wordcloud shows what we suspected, hip hop aim to provoke, with the profanities, the racial slurs and the mentions of violence the negative hip hop artists really try to grab the attention of the listeners using the obvious words to offend.</p>

        <p>This wordcloud contains the top tf-idf words for the artists with the highest sentiment values. This means that we here have the most distincitive words for the happiest artists in our graph.<br>
        It is clear that this wordcloud is far more positive than the one for the negative words, however with words like "stripper", "bunnies" and "kitty" it is clear that rappers will be rappers.</p>

                 <p><br><br>It is worth mentioning that only 36 out of 1062 artists was in either the positive or negative spectrum based on the low and high cutoff in the sentiment distribution. These cutoffs are made by taking the mean sentiment value and adding/subtracting two times the standard deviation.<br>
                 This means that most artists have a fairly neutral mean vocabulary, including the top 10 artist listed in the previous section, meaning that going for extremes won't necessarily conclude in popularity.</p>
