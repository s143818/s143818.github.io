          <h3>Motivation and goal</h3>
          <p>Music is an important part of the everyday life for most people. Whether it be music for a party, for the bus or the inescapable noice you hear in a telephone queue, it affects us in some way or another. But which words are we actually hearing when we put on our headphones? Are we exposing ourselves to positive or negative messages? Are we subconsciously choosing to listen to negative songs or postitive? And lastly how does the artists connect to one another, and what information can we derive from the different groupings? <br><br>

These are the questions we seek to answer in this study and to do just that we need some data. But to get these data, we first need to limit our search. There are quite frankly too many artists across the world for us to take them all into account with the limited computer power that we possess, so in order to make it manageble we chose to focus on only one particular genre of music.

                <b>Hip Hop</b></p>
            <p>

With it's rich history, interesting vocabulary and amazing artists we believe that we can uncover quite a lot of hidden secrets within this branch of music, as well as proving/disproving wether hip hop music is as violent/negative as people believe it to be.

          <h3>Dataset</h3>
          <p>As mentioned, we are using the wikipedia list of important hip hop artists to limit the scope of artists in the hip hop genre. After that we are using the genius API to extract the necesary data and link the artists based on the collaborations they've had on songs. We're using the amount of collaboration between two artists as the weight of the link, and we are adding five attributes to each node: Popularity, followers, twitter-handle, facebook name and instagram-name. Each artist also have as attributes the songs they've made or collaborated on, and these songs have the attributes: hotness, pyongs, release date, page views, media platforms and title.</p>

                Here we see the network of artists and the songs that they have collaborated on and that therefore connect them. At the edges of the graph, small nodes can be seen without any connections, this can occur if an artist hasn't collaborated with anyone, perhaps because they are unpopular, do not use the Genius platform or simply likes doing things alone.<br><br></p></div>

                Communities in dense networks can often be hard to see with the naked eye. The concept is based on the fact that within any network there will be some groups of nodes that are more densely connected than others, this can in this case be caused by the fact that some artists are better friends with one another than others, or maybe because some artists are connected through their chosen genre. <br>
                We have decided to check if the latter is true... REMEMBER TO WRITE.<br><br></p></div>

                 On genius there is an attribute for each song that denotes the song hot or not. In this graph we see <orange>all the artists who does <b>NOT</b> have any hot songs colored orange</orange>, and <red>the <b>HOT</b> artists are colored in red.</red><br>
                  As seen on the graph genius only thinks that four artists got what it takes namely: Eminem, Travis Scott, XXXTENTACION and Mariah Carey (which could have something to do with the fact that we pulled this information close to christmas).<br>
              This however only seem to prove that maybe the genius attribute isn't that much to go on, when only 4 out of 110632 songs were shown as being hot.<br><br></p></div>

      <p>Above is two plots of the degree distribution. The degree distribution in this case describes the amount of unique people an artist have collaborated with. As it can be seen on the graph the degree distribution follows a power law distribution. This means that if an artist in the network is popular, then he or she is more likely to make new collaborations that others. This can be easily translated to the graph as more artist would have a desire to collaborate with more well known artists either to boost their own success through their followers, or simply because they would be more likely to have heard of a popular artist that matched a certain music style. This results in a distribution where a lot of the artist only have one or two connections, whilst popular artists can have up to 250 collaborations with.</p>

        <h3>Cliques</h3>
		<p>Even if the degree distribution follows a power law distribution, meaning that a lot of nodes only have very few links, the graph is still full of connections. There are a lot of ways to group artists together such as the community method as seen above. Another way includes a specific centrality measure, mainly cliques. A clique is a group of artists where all the artists have connections to all other artists in the clique. If you were to move the slider beneath you would notice that both the value and the graph is changing. The value shows how big cliques we are looking for, if we have a value of three, and an artist is visible, then it means that the artist is a part of one or multiple three-artist-cliques where everyone is connected to oneanother. As the value reach fourteen you will see the names of the people in the largest clique.<br><br></p>

      </div>
      <p>Based on these graphs we can conclude that even though a lot of nodes do not have a high degree, then they are still quite connected to the rest of the graph considering that GET A PERCENTAGE of the nodes is in a 3-clique, and GET ANOTHER NUMBER is in a 4-clique. We can also conclude that the most interconnected artist, aka the ones in the 14-clique are quite famous artists.</p>

        <h3>Overall sentiment</h3>
        <p>The overall sentiment of the hip hop artist is actually slightly above average. With a mean value of 5.38 on a scale that goes from 1 to 9, this seems like a good indication that the bad reputation hip hop artists have when it comes to a negative influence is highly overrated. </p>

        <h3>Negative wordcloud</h3>
        <p>To investigate this further we decided to look at some of the distinctive words for artists with both the most negative and the most positive sentiment values. <br>This wordcloud contains the top tf-idf words for the artists with the lowest sentiment values. This means that we here have the most distincitive words for the negative artists in our graph.<br>
          This wordcloud shows what we suspected, hip hop aim to provoke, with the profanities, the racial slurs and the mentions of violence the negative hip hop artists really try to grab the attention of the listeners using the obvious words to offend.</p>

        <h3>Positive wordcloud</h3>
        <p>This wordcloud contains the top tf-idf words for the artists with the highest sentiment values. This means that we here have the most distincitive words for the happiest artists in our graph.<br>
        A funny aspect of this wordcloud is that even if there are a lot of happy words, these are not the most prominent of them all. This means that even happy hip hop artists aren't recognized for their happy style of writing.</p>

             <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 service"> 
                 <p><br><br>It is worth mentioning that only 35 out of 1062 artists was in either the positive or negative spectrum based on the low and high cutoff in the sentiment distribution. These cutoffs are made by taking the mean sentiment value and adding/subtracting two times the standard deviation.<br>
                 This means that most artists have a fairly neutral mean vocabulary, including the top 10 artist listed in the previous section, meaning that going for extremes won't necessarily conclude in popularity.</p>
